# -Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-TensorFlow
In this project, I created a Neural Network model to perform handwritten digit recognition. I used MNIST dataset which is available in TensorFlow datasets.  
In this dataset, there are 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. 
The images are represented as a 28 x 28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.
